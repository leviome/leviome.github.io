<br>

2. 2D/3D Game Focus Estimation:
Estimate an area where stories happen. Using GNNs to estimate 3D game focus, and fully convolution to estimate 2D focus.

3. Key Player Recognition:
Recognize the role of on-field players by analyzing the formation and context information with GNNs.

4. Ball Carrier Estimation in NFL games
Estimate the palyer who holds ball in the gridiron. Treating every player as a node of a graph, and modelling them with Graph Attention Nets.

5. Hard Examples Mining for ball detection
